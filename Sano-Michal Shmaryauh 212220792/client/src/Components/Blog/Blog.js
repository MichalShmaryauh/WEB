        Our house is much more than four walls,
        <br/>
        kitchen, bathroom,living room and bedrooms.
        <br/>
        A home is a family, it is people, it is a living and changing creature,
        <br/>
        that needs to be nurtured and loved. In our blog you will fi nd out how much.
        <br/>
        Our three bloggers, are housemates. They raise a family,
        <br/>
        live and work inside the house, soil it and clean it.
        <br/>
        Their blogs tell home stories that anyone can identify with,
        <br/> 
        and also provide small and helpful advice, 
        <br/>
        from experience and love gained over many years of cleanliness,
        <br/>
         order and clutter.

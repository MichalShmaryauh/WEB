        <br/>
        Jubilee years ago, in a small hall on Lavenda Street in Tel Aviv,
        <br/> 
        Bruno Landsberg set up a small factory for cleaning products.
        <br/>
        The factory employed 3 workers who created the company's 
        <br/>
        first two products-mothballs against moths in cellophane bags
        <br/>
        and a product for cleaning toilets in a
        <br/>
        sealed plastic bottle in a pink color.
        <br/>
        Bruno gave the toilet product the name "Snow"
        <br/>
        a Latin name that means clean,
        <br/>
        and originates from the saying "Mens sana in corpore sano",
        <br/> 
        which means "healthy mind in a healthy body".
        <br/>
         The product was a great success and its catchy name 
        <br/>
        became a brand that accompanies all the company's products.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h1><b>Sano - a sustainable Israeli pride</b></h1>
        <br/>
        Today, Snow manufactures in five factories, all over the country,
        <br/>
         more than 500 different products in a wide range of areas -laundry products,
        <br/>
        home care products, cleaning and hygiene products,
        <br/>
        kitchen accessories and products, air fresheners,insecticides,
        <br/>
        paper products and more.Since its inception,
        <br/> 
        Snow has regretted several important principles: 
        <br/>
        providing quality and effective solutions to cleaning and maintenance problems,
        <br/>
         preserving the environment,maintaining equality
        <br/> 
         for all its employees and managers, and constant listening to customers.
        <br/>
        The company's customer relations department  provides a courteous response
        <br/>
         and professional advice to all inquiries and enables daily dialogue with customers. 
        <br/>
        Thanks to the relationship with the customers, some of Snow's winning products 
        <br/>
        were born and  there is a constant improvement in the existing products.
        <br/>
        The Jubilee celebrations give us a great opportunity to look back on the past with pride,
        <br/>
        to look directly at the great present and to keep our eyes peeled for a groundbreaking future,
        <br/> 
        for you and for us.
